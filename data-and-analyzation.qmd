## Final Project: Predicting Billionaires by Jayden Lewis 

## Read in Data 
```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(tidygraph)
billionaires <- read.csv("billionaires.csv")
```
## Mutating Variables I'm working with
```{r}
project_variables <- billionaires |>
  select(wealth.worth.in.billions, wealth.how.industry, wealth.how.inherited, company.founded)

project_variables <- project_variables |>
  mutate(industry = case_when(
    wealth.how.industry %in% c("Technology-Computer", "Technology-Medical") ~ "Technology",
    wealth.how.industry %in% c("banking", "Hedge funds", "Money Management", "Venture Capital", "Private equity/leveraged buyout") ~ "Finance",
    wealth.how.industry %in% c("Consumer", "Retail, Restaurant") ~ "Consumer/Retail",
    TRUE ~ "Other"  # This line catches all other categories not explicitly listed above
  ))

project_variables <- project_variables |>
  mutate(inheritance = case_when(wealth.how.inherited %in% "not inherited" ~ "Not inherited",
        TRUE ~ "Inherited"))
project_variables <- project_variables |>
  mutate(century_founded = case_when(
    company.founded >= 1601 & company.founded <= 1700 ~ "17th Century",
    company.founded >= 1701 & company.founded <= 1800 ~ "18th Century",
    company.founded >= 1801 & company.founded <= 1900 ~ "19th Century",
    company.founded >= 1901 & company.founded <= 2000 ~ "20th Century",
    company.founded >= 2001 & company.founded <= 2100 ~ "21st Century",
    TRUE ~ "Unknown"
  ))


```

## Regresion Model
```{r}
M1 <- lm(wealth.worth.in.billions ~  industry + inheritance + century_founded, data = project_variables)

tidy(M1)
```
## Plots 
```{r}
project_variables |>
  ggplot(aes(x = industry, y = wealth.worth.in.billions, color = inheritance)) +
  facet_wrap(~century_founded) + 
  geom_point()
```
